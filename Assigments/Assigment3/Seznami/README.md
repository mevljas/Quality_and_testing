# 3. Assigment
a) Complete the example with the user interface for the `isTop string` and `search string` commands, of course together with all the relevant tests (user interface and stack) that you write before implementation in accordance with test-driven development (in SeznamiUV and Sklad).  

The isTop command checks to see if the specified string element is at the top of the stack. The command returns "OK" or the corresponding error: "Error: wrong element", "Error: stack is empty", "Error: please specify a string".  

The search command finds the specified element in a stack and returns its position (0 is at the top, 1 is lower than one, etc.), or -1 if the specified element is not in accordance. If the command is not specified correctly, it returns "Error: please specify a string".  

b) Complete the exercise example so that the testPushMultipleWords () and testPopMultipleWords () tests are successful.
