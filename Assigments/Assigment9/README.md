# 9. Assigment

Write a test case for the save() method on any data structure (stack, priority queue, or bst) when there is not enough disk space to create a new file.

- try to cause the error first by using a full USB stick
- the error that returns in this case is then simulated with a "mock" object in two ways:
    - using a special replacement class
    - using the EasyMock framework
