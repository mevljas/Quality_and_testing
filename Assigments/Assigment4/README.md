# 4. Assigment
1) Extend the integration tests for the SeznamiUV  class with all the tests for the priority queue (for 6 methods).

    - It is also necessary to add the code (three case parts) in the SeznamiUV 
    - Write only the tests that are needed
2) In the PrioritetnaVrsta.java file, correct the add() method so that the testAddOverflow() is also performed.

    - Tip: The array should increase 2x each time it overflows
3) Also customize the Sklad class by implementing the Seznam interface. At the same time, rename the methods accordingly and fix the SeznamiUV  user interface (say s_add instead of push, s_size instead of count ...).
