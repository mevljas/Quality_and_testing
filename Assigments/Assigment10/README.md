# 10. Assigemnt
a) Adapt the remaining commands to work with both comparators (makes sense for all three substructures):
- all changes (add, removeFirst, remove, reset) occur in both lists
- note that getFirst and removeFirst work on the first item in the list sorted by first and last name
- print and depth are displayed for both lists
- save the contents of the lists separately in two files (say data_p.bin and data_t.bin), and restore them from the two files in the same way
b) Use system tests to verify that both structures are stored and restored correctly.
