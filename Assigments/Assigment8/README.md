# 8. Assigment

# Task:

- Implement the **print**, **save**, and **restore** methods for the stack and priority queue data structure (for the priority queue, the print command can draw either a heap or a queue)
- Implement system tests for the **print**, **save**, and **restore** methods also for the data structure stack and priority queue
- Correct the exit command so that the tests in the **test_exit.py** file run successfully
