and failures, testing principles, test planning,
system testing, automated testing, testing
documentation
2. Model-Driven Test Design
3. Testing using graph coverage criteria
4. Testing using logic coverage criteria

7. Testing coverage summary
8. Testing of specific technologies
9. Testing tools
###Software quality
1. Introduction to software quality
2. Models and standards: quality models, ISO
standards and models, Capability Maturity Models
(CMMI)
3. Team software process (TSP)
4. Personal software process (PSP)
5. Software metrics
##Objectives and competences
The objective of the course is the students to become
acquainted with different software testing approaches,
and models and standards in the field of software
quality. The emphasis is on the acquisition of knowledge
for practical use of testing tools, and the use of efficient
approaches for software quality assurance.
###General competences
ability of critical thinking,
developing skills in critical, analytical and synthetic
thinking,
the ability to define, understand and solve creative
professional challenges,
the ability of professional communication in the native
language as well as a foreign language,
the ability to apply acquired knowledge in independent
work for solving technical and scientific; the ability to
upgrade acquired knowledge.
###Subject-specific competences
knowledge of basic terminology in the field of software
testing,
use of model-driven test design,
use of different criteria for effective testing: using
graph, program logic, input space partition and syntax
coverage,
knowledge of specific technologies testing specifics,
use of basic testing tools,
knowledge of basic terminology in the field of software
quality,
knowledge of main models and standards for software
quality assurance (ISO, CMMI),
use of software quality assurance approach for
individual use,
knowledge of basic terminology in the field of software
metrics.
##Intended learning outcomes
###Knowledge and understanding:
Understanding and knowledge of the properties of
different types of software testing; knowledge of
model-driven testing design and different testing
coverage criteria; practical understanding of the
meaning of disciplined process and usage of
standards/models for software development quality
assurance; knowledge the basic terminology in the field
of software metrics.
###Application
Practical knowledge and approaches in software testing,
practical knowledge of software metrics and properties
of software quality assurance process.
###Reflection:
Software testing presents the important part of
software development process, despite the fact that its
importance is often neglected. Similarly, this is also true
for quality assurance. Having the theoretical and
practical knowledge about the approaches and
possibilities increases the acceptance rate of described
methods, thus increases the quality of software.
###Transferable skills â€“ are not bound only to this course:
Practical knowledge in the field of software testing,
practical knowledge of the quality assurance
approaches, particularly metrics and models.
A self-control and ability to manage limited time when
preparing, planning and implementing plans and
processes. Team work, writing of reports, public
presentations of the results.
Coherent mastering of basic knowledge, gained through
mandatory courses, and the ability to combine the
knowledge from different fields and apply it in practice.
